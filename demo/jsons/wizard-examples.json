Observe that it defines a div with the class 'contentDiv'. This div is used to display the views associated with each step and so **should** be defined in the view for it to function as a wizard.\n\n* The template being displayed within the wizard is [hello-world](https://github.com/cloudmunch/marionette-wizard/blob/gh-pages/demo/javascript/templates/hello-world.dust)"

Unlike static steps, **all event handling has to be coded for within dynamic views**.\n\n* To let the wizard know that the view has finished processing, it can invoke `this.options.viewPromise.resolve()` or `this.options.viewPromise.reject()`"
